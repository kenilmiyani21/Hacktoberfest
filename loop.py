Python has two primitive loop commands:

  2.for loops

Loop control - Loop control statements are used when a section of code may either be executed a fixed number of times, or while some condition is true

While - The while loop keeps repeating an action until an associated condition returns false

# Else statement - This repeatedly tests the condition and, if it is True, executes the Statement 1; if the condition is False (which may be the first time it is tested) the Statement 2 of the else clause, is executed and the loop terminates. The else suite will be always executed irrespective of the statements in the loop are executed or not

For loop
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence
that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

range of function (start, stop, interval)
range(6) = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
-----------------------------------------------'''

for lst in range(6):
    print(lst)

'''-----------------------------------------------
The range() function defaults to 0 as a starting value,
however it is possible to specify the starting value by adding a parameter: range(2, 6),
which means values from 2 to 6 (but not including 6):
-----------------------------------------------'''

for x in range(1, 6):
    print(x, "Harsh")

'''-----------------------------------------------
The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1,
however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, 3)
-----------------------------------------------'''

# The else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished:
